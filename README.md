Write a program that takes a simple math expression as input (e.g. "7 + 3 * 2 - 4 / 2"), and evaluates it respecting the order of operations (BODMAS/BIDMAS).
Requirements:
Prompt the user to enter an arithmetic expression, e.g.,
7 + 3 * 2 - 4 / 2
Your program must:
Parse the expression (split it into numbers and operators).
Evaluate multiplication and division first, then addition and subtraction.
Support positive integers and spaces between expressions.
Display the final result.
Use only:
Arrays
Functions
Conditionals
Loops
Basic string methods (split(), trim(), etc.)
